eventually, want resource gathering to be done by mice who harvest at resource nodes and deliver stuff to inventories.
(maybe just one inventory per settlement?)

for now, have "mice" without game objects who just harvest and send directly to inventories.
have a population census that tracks all the mice and their jobs. and allow reassigning from here.

5/5

move the a star stuff to animal game object!

remove smoothing / set waypoint distance small!

define connections my way! so that it makes sense with verticality.

add ladders! and stairs!c

wanna have woodcutters drop wood items

wanna have haulers haul them

6/9
do the navigation stuff later?

we can start with clicker game style. 

can transition into having distinct workers / jobs later.

how do i handle item stacks?
mining gives a stack of stone. 
the stone should be separable into various ores and stones with the right tech...
a pile can hold 1 stack.
say you have a pile of 100 already mined mixed stone 
it really is 20 iron ore and 80 granite or whatever 

        the broad categories are used in general but with really shitty results.
        you can grow specific herbs.
the two options are 
    - have secretly differentiated stone 
        - mining yields a "single stack" of "stone"
        - when you mine stone from one spot and then another
            - it is different stone... um...
            - stone 5486 has 20 hematite and 80 granite
            - stone 230 just has 100 granite
            - the stack of stone is actually up to 100 different stacks of stone 
            - seems computationally tough. but doable? 
        - an item stack can be a normal stack 
            - with just an amount and an itemid 
        - or a composite stack  (do later)
            - with several hidden normal stacks inside 
            - contains 40 stone 5486 and 59 stone 230 and 1 stone 1902
            - analysis of a stack yields the component ores (hematite, granite) 
                - so this yields like 85 granite and 14 hematite and 1 gold
                - you now need to store 3 stacks
            - for herbs. you have a composite herb stack of 20 herb temp cul and 3 herb temp medi.
                - analysis yields 15 mint 5 thyme 2 hyssop 1 henna 
                - actually i think herbs maybe should just all be discovered?
                - herbs just come from foraging in different places?
            - for sand. you have a composite sand stack of 18 quartz sand and 2 iron sand 
                - analysis yields 18 quartz sand and 2 iron sand
in summary, discovery is: 
    single stack of stone (maybe call it "raw granite"?)
    analysis yields several stacks of stones and minerals
    can process those stones and minerals 
        - hematite -> iron -> steel
how many item types do i roughly expect a player to have? 
    - 50 stones 
    - 30 ores 
    - 20 metals / fully processed earth resources 
    - 50 plants + 50 seeds
    - 10 food types 
    - 10 woods 
    - 20 magic resources 
    - like 20 x 10 furnitures 
    - like 20 x 10 tools / weapons ?
    - like 100s of books (one for each tech?) 
    - overall about 200 stackable resources 
    - and 500 unstackable resources (furniture, tools, books)
    - a cabinet can hold 4 stacks of 100. so you need like 50 cabinets end game 
        - seems reasonable.
    - early game you just have
        - wood, stone, soil, wheat
