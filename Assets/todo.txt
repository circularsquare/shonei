eventually, want resource gathering to be done by mice who harvest at resource nodes and deliver stuff to inventories.
(maybe just one inventory per settlement?)

for now, have "mice" without game objects who just harvest and send directly to inventories.
have a population census that tracks all the mice and their jobs. and allow reassigning from here.

5/5

remove smoothing / set waypoint distance small!

define connections my way! so that it makes sense with verticality.

add ladders! and stairs!c
