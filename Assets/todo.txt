- haulers: 
    - right now haulers 50/50 between delivering to blueprints and doing other hauling.
        - want to make this a smarter decision.
        - also want to jitter which locations it picks up / delivers to so it doesnt juts repetitively serve one guy creating stuff.
    - have them pick up bigger stacks rather than just keep picking up closer one...
        - maybe change Find to take an integer score returning thing instead of a bool.
    - also rename haulers to "workers?" or maybe have builders be separate idk.
    - also want to add construction prgoress.
        - visible in info panel.

    - have info panel cycle through when you click it again.

BUGS
- multiple blueprints on same tile, they get lost. disallow or fix.
- mice are not reserving houses!

- occasionally haulers lose their target and get stuck somehow??
- screen jitters when dragging around

- hauler is only picking up a few wood at a time?
- sometimes target buttons stop working
- wheat inventory display doesn't update immediately when building a wheat? maybe has to do with it being a child resource idk.
