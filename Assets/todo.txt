- haulers: 
    - right now haulers 50/50 between delivering to blueprints and doing other hauling.
        - want to make this a smarter decision.
    - also rename haulers to "workers?" or maybe have builders be separate idk.
    - also want to add construction prgoress. and resource delivery progress.
        - visible in info panel. 
- info panel: 
    - have info panel cycle through when you click it again.
- blueprints   
    - have it work for building tiles (have a generic way of building any tile? or only some hardcoded ones.)
        - maybe only need soil, stone, wood, and a few others. idk.
- animal
    - split logic into separate files depending on job type (on second thought maybe not? they should be able to do all these things. jobs are not identity.)

- crafting 
    - select a recipe 
        - select one that there are enough resources to make.
    - set worktile to required work station. reserve it 
    - haul materials to work station inv (taking extra if there is a lot?)
        - make sure there's enough room in work station inv 
    - craft
    - drop product in work station inv. 
        - maybe make more
    - drop unuseful stuff.

- items 
    - add capacity bars 
    - haulers remove items from inventories where they're not allowed
- haulers 
    - if they see one item they can't store, they won't keep looking for farther items that they can store.


BUGS
- occasionally haulers lose their target and get stuck somehow??
    -- seems to be when inv is full or can't receive, like if suddne disallow.
- screen jitters when dragging around
- fix building buy display to not overlap text
- haulers still have like wood x 0, should clear that out
