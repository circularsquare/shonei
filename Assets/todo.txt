- haulers: 
    - right now haulers 50/50 between delivering to blueprints and doing other hauling.
        - want to make this a smarter decision.
    - also rename haulers to "workers?" or maybe have builders be separate idk.
    - also want to add construction prgoress. and resource delivery progress.
        - visible in info panel. 
- info panel: 
    - have info panel cycle through when you click it again.
- blueprints   
    - have it work for building tiles (have a generic way of building any tile? or only some hardcoded ones.)
        - maybe only need soil, stone, wood, and a few others. idk.

    -- seems to be when inv is full or can't receive, like if suddne disallow.
- screen jitters when dragging around
