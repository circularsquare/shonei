- haulers: 
    - right now haulers 50/50 between delivering to blueprints and doing other hauling.
        - want to make this a smarter decision.
        - also want to jitter which locations it picks up / delivers to so it doesnt juts repetitively serve one guy creating stuff.
    - have them pick up bigger stacks rather than just keep picking up closer one...
        - maybe change Find to take an integer score returning thing instead of a bool.
    - also rename haulers to "workers?" or maybe have builders be separate idk.
    - also want to add construction prgoress.
        - visible in info panel. 
- info panel: 
    - have info panel cycle through when you click it again.
- blueprints   
    - have it work for building tiles (have a generic way of building any tile? or only some hardcoded ones.)
        - maybe only need soil, stone, wood, and a few others. idk.
    - give inventories (of 0 capacity) that can have allow lists
- animal
    - clean up so many functions... 
    - allow for animals to do other jobs if not busy
    - lt: add leisure
- building 
    - add discovered
    - make buiding menu bigger... have it replace item menu.
    - add tile building (dirt: just turns into dirt tile)
- crafting 
    - have product appear in workshop inventory or animal inventory instead of floor?
        - reserve storage space?
        - add workshop inventory...
- fix destroy button
- ui
    - add highlight on currently selected menu

- inventory
    - have a "keep" setting that invs can toggle to keep food for consumption and stuff like that. 

- plant
    - flesh out plant growth
        - add placeholder methods and things for checking moisture and temperature 
    - implement harvesting taking time // have this be like "task" and have it be generic for construction as well?
        - add harvesting method for mineral tiles 
    - have plant building disappear? and have blueprint auto create.
    - acorn sprite
    - make plant tile sprites start at 0
    - sync plant and building constructors!

- food
    - don't allow them to eat last food seeds

BUGS
- occasionally haulers lose their target and get stuck somehow??
- screen jitters when dragging around

- hauler is only picking up a few wood at a time?
- sometimes target buttons stop working
- wheat inventory display doesn't update immediately when building a wheat? maybe has to do with it being a child resource idk.
