eventually, want resource gathering to be done by mice who harvest at resource nodes and deliver stuff to inventories.
(maybe just one inventory per settlement?)

for now, have "mice" without game objects who just harvest and send directly to inventories.
have a population census that tracks all the mice and their jobs. and allow reassigning from here.

5/5

move the a star stuff to animal game object!

remove smoothing / set waypoint distance small!

define connections my way! so that it makes sense with verticality.

add ladders! and stairs!c

wanna have woodcutters drop wood items

wanna have haulers haul them

do the navigation stuff later?

we can start with clicker game style. 

can transition into having distinct workers / jobs later.

how do i handle item stacks?
mining gives a stack of stone. 
the stone should be separable into various ores and stones with the right tech...
a pile can hold 1 stack.
say you have a pile of 100 already mined mixed stone 
it really is 20 iron ore and 80 granite or whatever 

        the broad categories are used in general but with really shitty results.
        you can grow specific herbs.
the two options are 
    - have secretly differentiated stone 
        - mining yields a "single stack" of "stone"
        - when you mine stone from one spot and then another
            - it is different stone... um...
            - stone 5486 has 20 hematite and 80 granite
            - stone 230 just has 100 granite
            - the stack of stone is actually up to 100 different stacks of stone 
            - seems computationally tough. but doable? 
        - an item stack can be a normal stack 
            - with just an amount and an itemid 
        - or a composite stack  (do later)
            - with several hidden normal stacks inside 
            - contains 40 stone 5486 and 59 stone 230 and 1 stone 1902
            - analysis of a stack yields the component ores (hematite, granite) 
                - so this yields like 85 granite and 14 hematite and 1 gold
                - you now need to store 3 stacks
            - for herbs. you have a composite herb stack of 20 herb temp cul and 3 herb temp medi.
                - analysis yields 15 mint 5 thyme 2 hyssop 1 henna 
                - actually i think herbs maybe should just all be discovered?
                - herbs just come from foraging in different places?
            - for sand. you have a composite sand stack of 18 quartz sand and 2 iron sand 
                - analysis yields 18 quartz sand and 2 iron sand
in summary, discovery is: 
    single stack of stone (maybe call it "raw granite"?)
    analysis yields several stacks of stones and minerals
    can process those stones and minerals 
        - hematite -> iron -> steel
how many item types do i roughly expect a player to have? 
    - 50 stones 
    - 30 ores 
    - 20 metals / fully processed earth resources 
    - 50 plants + 50 seeds
    - 10 food types 
    - 10 woods 
    - 20 magic resources 
    - like 20 x 10 furnitures 
    - like 20 x 10 tools / weapons ?
    - like 100s of books (one for each tech?) 
    - overall about 200 stackable resources 
    - and 500 unstackable resources (furniture, tools, books)
    - a cabinet can hold 4 stacks of 100. so you need like 50 cabinets end game 
        - seems reasonable.
    - early game you just have
        - wood, stone, soil, wheat

next steps 
- add tree sprite 
    - have woodcutters walk to tree to chop it 
    - produce / add to wood item stacks
- add generic "inventory" and rename "inventory" to globalInventory.
    - add an inventory to animals.
- search for nearby item stacks 
    - reserve stack so no one else takes it
- fetch item stacks
- transport item stacks to storage
    - porter just does this all the time? looks for stuff and delivers.

    - make items drop on floor
    - make porter a subclass of animal

- add build blueprints
    - add "build" process, builders will deliver materials then work on building.
- add work stations

how do animals decide where to work?
options are
    - (clicker game) assign number of each job 
    - (syx) assign number of animals at each workstation
    - (rimworld) assign work priorities to individual mice and they decide what to work on
    can't do rimworld because need to have fixed workstations to have local neighborhoods.
    clicker game is just less granular syx.
an animal picks where to work based off their personal skillset
    - then they pick a place to live near their workstation based off some utility function
    - periodically check if pairs of animals would be better off swapped
you assign number of jobs at each workstation...
    give one of 5 priorities to each workstation
    animals will fill based on priority, then skill.
right now i am using clicker game system. but will eventually transitition to syx.

how are resources delivered?
    - (rimworld) item produced goes on floor. then they pick it up and deliver at some pt
    - (syx) item produced goes on floor. warehouse porters deliver
    - (?) item produced goes in building storage. warehouse porters deliver
so for shonei
    - item produced goes on floor. (issue: too many different items from one tree?)
        - can one tile of floor hold several stacks of stuff?
        - it certainly can't display that many stacks of stuff.
        - using multiple tiles might be fine. just search the 5x5 neighborhood of tiles for an existing stack to dump each resource.
    - hauler finds an itemstack and designates that as work location
    - picks it up and then finds nearest appropriate warehouse.
    - the only way to move resources other than haulers is mice looking for materials.
        - so like a carpenter will search for wood on the ground or in warehouses
unemployed mice will be haulers?

made haulers!
items produced go on the floor (typically on the tile where they are produced. need to add "clustering?" for like farmers.)
and haulers pick them up.

yayyy!!!

i think i'll do a sorting order of 
foreground decoration - 50 (flowers? rain?)
animals - 40
items - 30
buildings - 20
tiles - 10
background - 0

9/2
- fixed item moving bug..
- added dirt sprite
- right now when building the items aren't taken out of anywhere. take out of a random inventory.
    - this is in BuildPanel! need to work on a lot of stuff.
- have haulers drop items they don't want
    - keep track of "desired items?"
        - if you're idle.. you don't want any items.
        - if you're working, it depends. unclear
- need to figure out why global wood is starting 1 higher than actual world wood...

9/21
- feel so tired today. 
- added blueprints!
    - right now haulers 50/50 between delivering to blueprints and doing other hauling.
    - want to make this a smarter decision.
    - also rename haulers to "workers?" or maybe have builders be separate idk.
    - also want to add construction prgoress. and resource delivery progress.
        - visible in info panel. need to add info panel for blueprints.

10/19
- added default building sprite 
- blueprint sprites grayed out
- fixed some null hauling issues.. so many
- made itemquantity a bit easier to work with. but still need to specify itemids. maybe make a spreadsheet
- planned out how crafters will work.

10/20
- added crafting!!! sawmill works.
    - added a new fetch mode for crafters, slightly different from haulers 
    - recipes
    - also made gatherers use recipes like crafters

10/27
- structured items in a tree
    - keep track of discovered items 
- add display for local inventories
    - add inventory allowed item lists (still need to have haulers remove disallowed items)
- translate item names from json to item ids while loading db
- fixed resources starting at 1 higher than they should
- fixed blueprints receiving wrong number of resources

10/28
- improved hauler logic, now they will keep searching for things to store instead of stopping when they find something to haul that they can't store
    - also desiredItemQuantity is more sensibly chosen
    - also remove from invs that dont allow
- fixed build menu appearance
- shrank animal bounding box
- added menu selection / compressed jobs, build, inv menus
- added item dropdowns with hiding undiscovered items
- cleaned up ui layout
- added item targets

10/29
- added recipe score based on target, used to order recipe priority (if target = 0, won't do at all)
- added batch processing! crafters will estimate numRounds possible to make and try to fetch required resources
    - untested for multi input recipes 
- added plant to db and build menu. yet to add way to construct, and actual plant functionality.
